**Companion** is a utility for testing and debugging your MCP servers
on macOS, iOS, and visionOS.
It's built using the
[official Swift SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/swift-sdk).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Companion is in early development and is still missing some important features,
> including authentication, roots, and sampling.

> For a more complete MCP debugging experience, check out the
> [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector).

## Features

- [x] Connect to local and remote MCP servers
- [x] Easily browse available prompts, resources, and tools

## Getting Started

First, [download the Companion app](https://github.com/mattt/Companion/releases/latest/download/Companion.zip)
(requires macOS 15 or later).

Or, if you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed,
you can run the following command:

When you open the app,
you'll see a sidebar on the left and a placeholder view on the right.
Click the <kbd>+</kbd> button in the toolbar to add an MCP server.

> [!TIP]
> Looking for a fun MCP server?
> Check out [iMCP](https://iMCP.app/?ref=Companion),
> which gives models access to your Messages, Contacts, Reminders and more.
>
> Click on the iMCP menubar icon,
> select "Copy server command to clipboard",
> and paste that into the "Command" field for your STDIO server.

Once you add a server,
it'll automatically connect.
When it does, it'll show available prompts, resources, and tools.
Click on one of those sections to see a list, and drill into whatever you're interested in.
Or, select the parent item in the sidebar to get information about the server.
